# Bootcamp GoStack Projects

Foi uma semana muito produtiva para consolidar alguns conceitos e aprender outros, construindo uma aplicação completa chamada Be The Hero.

✅ Backend: NodeJS, Express, TypeORM, PostgreSQL

✅ Fron-end: ReacJS

✅ Mobile: React Native

✅ Testes automatizados

## Dev Concepts

Small projects to understand simple concepts of Node.js and React stacks.
Project folder: [conceitos-dev](https://github.com/dbarjs/gostack/tree/master/conceitos-dev)

### Node.js (Back-end)

To undertand how to create a Rest API server, we started a back-end application with Express to create the first routers, we learn the basic of HTTP request methods (like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE). All API tests were done using the Insomnia tool.
Routes have been created to be used in front-end and mobile applications.
The purpose of this API is serve data from the user projects.

Some frameworks/libs used: [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) and [uuidv4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4).

### React.js (Front-end)

Started with React.js, JSX and Axios to create the really simple view of projects regitred on the server.
The purpose of this application is learn how to create a basic React web app with components
